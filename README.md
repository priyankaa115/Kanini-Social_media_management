DEVELOPEMENT OF SOCIAL NETWORKING PLATFORM INTEGRATED WITH ADVANCED MARKETING STRATEGY

INTRODUCTION:

The emergence of social media platforms has reshaped the way people communicate and exchange information. The motive of this project is to develop such a social media platform, ensuring a unique communicating experience. The increasing interconnection among people also elevates the need for the development of user-friendly platforms. The project aims to satisfy the need for such a user-friendly platform where people could communicate and share their thoughts.

Being more conscious about the userâ€™s privacy and security of information, this platform aims to redefine the social media landscape by prioritising the needs and preferences of the user base. By integrating developed technologies and future trends, the platform seeks to create a space that exceeds the ordinary, providing an environment that excites as well as empowers.
The extension of the project is to integrate the platform with certain improved marketing strategies. It also aims to alter the suggestions of the commercials based on the time slots, interest in certain topic discussions, and other preferences instead of using personal information such as age, etc.

The main motive of the platform is to benefit both the user and the advertisers. The marketing strategy implemented is more efficient than the regular strategy as it deals with time slots and preferences other than using the personal information of the user."LITERATURE SURVEY

The program for developing the social media platform has been successfully developed and debugged. However, due to some disruptions, the platform is unable to load successfully, hindering the integration of the marketing strategy.

Although the project is not completed, there is further room for improvisation once the platform has been loaded successfully.

Some of them include:
 
1.Analyzing the preferences and modifying them if they seem to be static or fixed. This is effective as it opens a room full of a wide range of products that benefit both the advertisers and the users of the platform

2.Expanding the recommendations to include other commercial elements, such as events and reality shows.
